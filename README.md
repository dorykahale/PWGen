This is a Password Generator that generates a string of random characters with options of character types set by the user to be used in other applications that may require various types of password parameters.

After clicking "Generate Password" buttion, the user is prompted to enter the number of characters he or she would like in their password. This number must be between 8-128.![Number of Characters prompt](/images/PW-Gen-1.png) 

If the user enters a number that doesn not fall within the required range, the user is prompted to enter a number between 8-128 before the application continues.

The user is then prompted to choose which character types to include in the password. ![Type of Characters prompt 1](/images/PW-Gen-2.png) ![Type of Characters prompt 2](/images/PW-Gen-3.png)

The user must include at least one character type from the following options:
1. Symbols
2. Numbers
3. Upper Case Letters
4. Lower Case Letters

If the user fails to choose at least one character type, a prompt lets them know they must choose at least one. The character type prompts restart after the user confirms.

Once the character types are chosen, a password is generated in the text box where the user can manually copy/cut the password & paste it into another application. ![Generated password in text box](/images/PW-Gen-4.png)
